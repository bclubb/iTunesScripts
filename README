This are some scripts that have been modified slightly from Doug Adams.  http://dougscripts.com/itunes/

My scripts are kept in ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts

http://dougscripts.com is the best resource for iTunes Applescripts if you are having any problems.  Don't hesitate to ask though if you have any questions.
